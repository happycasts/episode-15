now I know "apt-get update" will get me all the pkg name+info, of all the repos in sources.list
but my questions is where is the info saved on local drive?
Is it a same file that apt-cache uses?
Is it /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin?
what is /var/lib/dpkg/status?

SO, I guess it is like this:
1. apt-get install pkg-not-in-cache
   #this end up with a error
2. sudo apt-get update
   #get all pkg names of all repos in sources.list
3. apt-get intall pkg-now-in-cache
   #same pkg in step1 is now installed
