now I know "apt-get update" will get me all the pkg name+info, of all the repos in sources.list
but my questions is 

Q: where is the info saved on local drive?
A: plain text list: /var/lib/apt/lists
   binary: /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin

Q: Is it a same file that apt-cache uses?
A: Yes and No.
`apt-get update` will store same info in these two places.
But if I delete a package in the plain text version, apt-get still can tab complete the pkg name, but end result is a error:

  E: Package 'abrowser' has no installation candidate


what is /var/lib/dpkg/status? Installed packages list in current system, plz to go when you want to check the info of your installed package, and you don't want to remember all the fucking apt-cache commands and options


SO, I guess it is like this:
1. apt-get install pkg-not-in-cache
   #this end up with a error
2. sudo apt-get update
   #get all pkg names of all repos in sources.list
3. apt-get intall pkg-now-in-cache
   #same pkg in step1 is now installed



delete most repos in sources.list, and I have

    peter:/var/cache/apt$ du -sh pkgcache.bin 
    16M pkgcache.bin
    peter:/var/cache/apt$ du -sh pkgcache.bin 
    1.5M    pkgcache.bin
    peter:/var/cache/apt$ 

And I see this on web:

    pkgcache Apt’s memory mapped package cache location, normally /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin

    it is dangerous to delete pkgcache.bin ?
    No – package managers just make new one.
    Sometimes it is good to remove pkgcache.bin:
    apt-get, aptitude, synaptic, update- manager crash

    Try removing /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin and /var/cache/apt/srcpkgcache.bin then re-run apt-get update

this might be useful:
